//---------- Mini-Exercise 3
//
//            - add a void method, throwAway, to your Ingredient class that souts out "Throwing away ingredient..."
//            - override the method, throwAway, in your Jelly, PeanutButter, and Bread classes to sout out a more specific message (e.g. "Throwing away Jelly...", etc.)
//- add another method to the KitchenTool class and override it in the Knife and Plate classes.





//---------- Mini-Exercise 4
//
//            - add a protected integer property to Ingredient of calories
//- add a method to the Jelly class that prints out the calories
//- does the code work if you change the visibility of the calories to public? Private?
//            - create a package called "jelly" and place the Jelly class in it and experiment with public, private, protected visibility for calories
//


//---------- Mini-Exercise 5
//
//            - add a constructor to KitchenTool that sets all properties
//- resolve the compile error in the subclasses by adding a default constructor to KitchenTool
//- remove the default constructor and add a constructor to the child classes that calls the super constructor and sets the child class properties for Knife and Plate
//

//---------- Mini-Exercise 6
//
//            - create a class, IngredientTest, that has a main method
//- add a static void method, throwAwayIngredient that takes in an Ingredient instance and invokes the throwAway method
//- instantiate an instance of Jelly, PeanutButter, and Bread stored in type Ingredient
//- call the throwAwayIngredient() method multiple times passing various instances of the above ingredients
